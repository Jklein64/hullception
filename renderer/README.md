# About

This is a special image viewer built using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). Given an image, the viewer will plot each unique RGB color as a single point in RGB space inside of an interactive cube. Holding <kbd>shift</kbd> and clicking and dragging with the mouse allows for the selection of individual points, which will be highlighted in the image.

This viewer hopes to bridge the gap between the image and its point-cloud representation to see how deformities or irregularities in the 3D plot affect the image.

# Usage

1. Clone the repository and run `npm install` in the root directory
1. Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `localhost:1234`
